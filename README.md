# LoanTap-Credit-Analysis LoanTap Credit Analysis Readme
Business Problem
LoanTap faces the challenge of determining whether to extend a credit line to individuals and, if approved, what the optimal repayment terms should be. The goal is to minimize default risks and provide business recommendations for sustainable lending.

Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Inspection:
Checked dataset structure, characteristics, and general information.
Target Variable Analysis:
Explored dependencies of the loan_status (target variable) on various predictor variables using count plots, box plots, and heat maps.
Correlation Analysis:
Examined correlations among independent variables and their interactions.
Simple Feature Engineering Steps
Creation of Flags:
Introduced flags for variables like pub_rec, mort_acc, and pub_rec_bankruptcies.
Missing Values and Outlier Treatment
Outlier Detection:
Identified and treated outliers in relevant variables.
Scaling:
Utilized MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler for feature scaling.
Logistic Regression Model
Model Selection:
Implemented Logistic Regression from the Sklearn/Statsmodel library for credit analysis.
Results Interpretation:
Evaluated model results using classification report, ROC AUC curve, and precision-recall curve.
Results Evaluation
Classification Report:
Examined precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy.
ROC AUC Curve:
Analyzed the model's performance across different classification thresholds.
Multicollinearity Check using VIF:
Ensured independence of variables by examining Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
Recommendations
Feature Selection and Engineering:
Emphasize creditworthiness indicators like credit score, income stability, and employment history.
Create new features reflecting credit history length and open credit lines.
Advanced Modeling Techniques:
Explore ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for handling imbalanced datasets.
Implement techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance.
Tuning Model Parameters:
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance, especially those related to class imbalance.
Strict Approval Criteria:
Establish stringent criteria based on historical default data to minimize risky approvals.
Avoid lending to individuals with a history of late payments or bankruptcies.
Regulatory Compliance:
Ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines and industry best practices.
Stay updated on evolving regulations related to lending practices.
Alternative Data Usage:
Incorporate alternative data sources for a more comprehensive creditworthiness assessment.
Continuous Risk Assessment:
Implement continuous risk assessment mechanisms to monitor borrowers' financial behavior post-approval.
Utilize machine learning for early detection of financial distress signs.
Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into creditworthiness determinants and the model's performance in predicting loan outcomes. Recommendations focus on optimizing lending practices, minimizing risks, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to changing dynamics are crucial for sustained success in the lending industry.
